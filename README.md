# Princeps

**The DeFi prime broker L1 on Reth.**

Lending → options → structured products → institutional rails, on a single shared risk engine.

> *Princeps* (Latin: "first, prime, principal") — pronounced **PRIN-seps**. The title Augustus adopted when founding the Roman Principate. Now: the prime broker stack for on-chain finance.

---

## What it is

Princeps is an open-source, Reth-based L1 designed to be the DeFi-native counterpart of a TradFi prime broker. Where Hyperliquid reinvented perps by embedding the matching engine into the L1, and Tempo reinvented payments by embedding FX and auto-swap, Princeps reinvents the primitives that perps don't cover:

- **Lending** — deterministic sub-second liquidations as state transitions (not keeper auctions), portfolio margin, native flash loans
- **Options** — Black-Scholes / IV surfaces / Greeks as precompiles, auto-exercise at expiry block, vol surface as canonical state
- **Structured products** — native vault/strategy composition over lending + options, continuous NAV, no keepers, native fee waterfalls
- **Institutional rails** — KYC overlay for compliance-required tenants, native fund-admin primitives (NAV strip, attribution)

All four layers share one risk engine — so a strategy can sell a covered call, post the underlying as collateral, borrow against it, and rebalance — atomically, in a single block. That's the prime broker thesis.

## Positioning

**The L1 that's everything HL isn't.** Princeps explicitly does not build perps; HL owns that. Princeps is the lending / options / structured-products / institutional-rails complement.

One-line pitch: *"If HL is the on-chain CME, Princeps is the on-chain prime broker."*

## Roadmap

| Version | Scope | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **v0** | Lending — single asset pair (USDC collateral, ETH borrow), deterministic liquidations, portfolio margin | Q3 2026 |
| **v1** | Options — orderbook, vol surface, Greeks precompiles, cross-margin with lending | Q4 2026 / Q1 2027 |
| **v2** | Structured products — native vault composition, continuous NAV, Tempo settlement integration | Q2 2027 |
| **v3** | Institutional rails — KYC overlay (per-tenant opt-in), fund-admin primitives, decentralized sequencer | H2 2027 |

## Architectural decisions (locked)

Seven foundational decisions, locked for the platform lifecycle:

| ADR | Decision | Note |
|---|---|---|
| [001](./docs/adr/001-consensus-malachite.md) | Consensus: **Malachite** (Informal Systems) BFT | Instant finality, no reorgs |
| [002](./docs/adr/002-sequencer-centralized-then-decentralize.md) | Sequencer: **centralized v0–v1**, decentralize at v3 | Ship-fast, decentralize-later pattern |
| [003](./docs/adr/003-oracle-validator-quorum-push.md) | Oracle: **validator-quorum push** in EL | Sub-second updates, no external oracle |
| [004](./docs/adr/004-base-unit-usd-stable.md) | Base unit: **USD-stable** (USDC default; USDT, Tempo-stable at v1+) | |
| [005](./docs/adr/005-settlement-standalone-then-tempo.md) | Settlement: **standalone L1** v0–v1, Tempo settlement at v2 | |
| [006](./docs/adr/006-identity-anon-default-kyc-overlay.md) | Identity: **anon-default**, KYC as Layer-3 per-tenant overlay at v3 | Not chain-wide KYC |
| [007](./docs/adr/007-token-none-until-revenue.md) | Token: **none until real revenue** | Earliest consideration: post-v1 |

## Status

Princeps inherits a working Reth + Malachite kernel from [openhl](https://github.com/psyto/openhl) and extends it with the v0 lending kernel. Fully functional as of 2026-06-01. **369+ tests pass across 12 crates.**

**Built — kernel inherited from openhl (Stages 1–18a):**
- ✅ Consensus substrate (Reth + Malachite, 4-message bridge)
- ✅ Two-validator devnet with real follower replication via `ProposalAndParts`
- ✅ CLOB pure state machine
- ✅ Custom EVM precompiles (CLOB read + `place_order` + fill sink + `deposit` + `withdraw`)
- ✅ Funding state machine (per-block settlement applied to collateral)
- ✅ Liquidation (margin math, insurance fund, multi-account scanner, ADL — full safety-net loop closed)
- ✅ Oracle (median-of-medians + secp256k1-signed observations + publisher registry + cached aggregate persistence)
- ✅ Vault primitive (share-based, ERC-4626-style)
- ✅ Clearing (`apply_fill` state machine, bridge-owned account map, persistent across restarts)
- ✅ Node coordinator + `reth-devnet` boot ceremony (persistent MDBX, validator key persistence, chain-spec loading, per-block integration tick)
- ✅ Margin-aware withdraw with revert-safe precompile mutations (`PrincepsRevertGuard`)

**Built — v0 lending kernel (Stages 19–22b, shipped 2026-06-01):**
- ✅ `princeps-lending` crate — pure compute: market state, position state, kinked IRM, health factor compute, per-block interest accrual (61 tests across 5 modules)
- ✅ Bridge integration — `LiveRethEvmBridge` owns `BTreeMap<MarketId, Market>` + `BTreeMap<(AccountId, MarketId), Position>` with `with_*_mut` accessors
- ✅ Bridge mutation methods — `lending_deposit_collateral` / `lending_borrow` / `lending_repay` / `lending_withdraw_collateral` / `lending_liquidate`, with simulate-then-commit health gating
- ✅ Per-block lending tick — `lending_tick` accrues interest across all registered markets; `scan_lending_health` flags HF < 1.0 positions
- ✅ Six EVM precompiles at `0x0c1f`–`0x0c24` — full lending lifecycle callable from any Solidity contract (see [EVM precompiles](#evm-precompiles) below)

**Next (remaining v0 work):**
- 🚧 Unified scan report (combining perp + lending into one liquidation surface; Stage 22a)
- 🚧 Bad-debt absorption — when HF < 0, route to `InsuranceFund` via `PrincepsNode` (Stage 22c, cross-layer)
- 🚧 Cross-margin engine — lending and perp positions sharing one portfolio risk model (Stage 23, the prime broker thesis)
- 🚧 Single-asset-pair USDC/ETH devnet + CLI demo + sample liquidator bot (Stage 24)
- 🚧 Multi-validator network expansion (3+ validators) building on Stage 18a follower replication
- 🚧 Public testnet deploy

**Pure / I-O split:** state machines (`types`, `codec`, `clob`, `funding`, `liquidation`, `oracle`, `vault`, `lending`) have no I/O — deterministic, microsecond unit tests. I/O boundary (`evm`, `consensus`, `node`) talks to the outside world.

**Workspace defaults:** edition 2024, resolver 3, rust 1.95+, `unsafe_code = forbid`, release LTO + abort + strip.

**Pin policy:** Reth v2.2.0, Malachite v0.5.0, alloy v1.5 / v2.0 — release-tag SHAs only, dedicated PR per bump.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# >>> START HERE: cross-margin demo (Stage 24b) <<<
# Runs Alice's canonical prime-broker scenario in ~1 second:
# deposit USDC → borrow ETH → open perp → market crash → show siloed vs unified margin
cargo run --release -- lending-demo
# Try different crash prices:
cargo run --release -- lending-demo --eth-crash-price 85

# Sample liquidator bot (Stage 24e) — seeds 5 accounts, raises ETH price,
# scans for underwater positions, liquidates them in order of most-underwater,
# falls back to bad-debt absorption when collateral can't cover.
cargo run --release --bin princeps-liquidator-bot
cargo run --release --bin princeps-liquidator-bot -- --eth-price 3

# HTTP RPC server (Stage 24d) — read-only JSON endpoints over an in-process
# bridge with the same 5 seeded accounts. Then in another terminal:
#   curl http://localhost:8080/lending/markets
#   curl http://localhost:8080/lending/positions
#   curl 'http://localhost:8080/lending/scan?perp_mark=0&perp_im_bps=0&coll_price=1&debt_price=2'
#   curl 'http://localhost:8080/lending/health?account=1&perp_mark=0&perp_im_bps=0&coll_price=1&debt_price=2'
cargo run --release --bin princeps-lending-rpc-server

# Per-step lending CLI (Stage 24c) — hands-on lending against a local JSON
# state sandbox at $HOME/.princeps/lending-state.json. Each command persists
# its mutation; perfect for exploration without writing Rust.
cargo run --release --bin princeps -- lending init
cargo run --release --bin princeps -- lending deposit 1 1000
cargo run --release --bin princeps -- lending borrow 1 200 --eth-price 1
cargo run --release --bin princeps -- lending list
cargo run --release --bin princeps -- lending health 1 --eth-price 6   # LIQUIDATABLE
cargo run --release --bin princeps -- lending scan --eth-price 6
cargo run --release --bin princeps -- lending repay 1 100

# Single-validator devnet (in-memory bridge)
cargo run --release -- devnet 1

# Single-validator devnet with real Reth EVM
cargo run --release -- reth-devnet 1 --moniker dev0

# Multi-validator scaffolding
cargo run --release -- reth-devnet 1 \
  --chain-spec ./chain.json \
  --validators ./validators.json \
  --listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/26656 \
  --rpc-bind 0.0.0.0:8545
```

Data and validator key default to `$HOME/.princeps/data` and `$HOME/.princeps/validator_key.json` (perms 0o600).

The `lending-demo` subcommand is the fastest way to see what Princeps does. It produces:

```
            View                       Free equity       Verdict
            Siloed (perp only)                -140       LIQUIDATABLE
            Unified (perp + lending)           360       HEALTHY
```

Same account, two ways of computing margin. Siloed → forced liquidation. Unified portfolio (the prime broker thesis) → position stays open because the lending collateral backs the perp position.

## EVM precompiles

Princeps reserves the `0x0000...0c1*` address range for custom precompiles. Any Solidity contract can call them via standard `call` / `staticcall`.

| Address | Precompile | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| `0x...0c1b` | `clob_read_best_bid` | 9b |
| `0x...0c1c` | `clob_place_order` | 9c |
| `0x...0c1d` | `princeps_deposit` (perp collateral in) | 17c |
| `0x...0c1e` | `princeps_withdraw` (perp collateral out, margin-aware) | 17e+ |
| `0x...0c1f` | `princeps_lending_deposit_collateral` | 21a |
| `0x...0c20` | `princeps_lending_borrow` | 21b |
| `0x...0c21` | `princeps_lending_repay` | 21c |
| `0x...0c22` | `princeps_lending_withdraw_collateral` | 21d |
| `0x...0c23` | `princeps_lending_health` (staticcall-safe) | 21e |
| `0x...0c24` | `princeps_lending_liquidate` | 22b |

ABI for lending precompiles: `(uint64 account, uint32 market_id, uint128 amount [, uint128 collateral_price, uint128 debt_price])` returning `uint256` (success indicator or computed value in low 16 bytes). The borrow/withdraw/health/liquidate precompiles require prices passed in calldata; v1 will switch to an installed oracle global. See `crates/evm/src/precompiles/mod.rs` for exact shapes per precompile.
